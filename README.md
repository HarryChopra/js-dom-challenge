# The DOM Challenge

## Objective

Write a small application using the html and stylesheets provided. It should have a few features:

-   A Counter that increases by 1 each second
-   Plus and Minus buttons that increment or decrement the counter
-   A 'like' button (❤️) that adds a 'like' for the number that is currently
    displayed by the timer
-   A comment box that adds comments when submitted

## Deliverables

1. As a user, I should see the timer increment every second once the page has
   loaded.
2. As a user, I can manually increment and decrement the counter using the plus
   and minus buttons.
3. As a user, I can 'like' an individual number of the counter. I should see the
   count of the number of 'likes' associated with that number displayed.
4. As a user, I can pause the counter, which should:

-   pause the counter
-   disable all buttons except the pause button
-   switch the label on the button from "pause" to "resume"

5. As a user, I should be able to click the "restart" button to restart the
   counter and re-enable the buttons.
6. As a user, I can leave comments on my gameplay, such as: "Wow, what a fun
   game this is."
